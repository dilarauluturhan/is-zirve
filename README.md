## Features✨
My project aims to list the job post. I aimed to filter and list the information I wrote in the JSON file. If I talk about the features of my project, I managed the situation using useState. I used the useNavigate and useSearchParams features with React Router DOM feature. There is input and search button in the mains of my project. You search in Input and list the job post. You move on to the next page with the "Daha fazla..." button. This page has input and search button. You can also search here. All job postings are on this page. You can switch between pages with Pagination. With the filtering feature, you can reach the job posting you are looking for. You can also see it as a parameter in the URL.
